	* Fix so that will compile without 0.15.7, fixed configure so that
	  library *and supporting libraries* will be detected properly
	  (may be necessary for some non-Linux systems).
	* Use FTP's `R' (record) structure transfer mode so that we only
	  have to make a guess about LRL which is >= end of last field we
	  need.

	* Password can now be specified by using ASDBGET_PASSWORD environment
	  variable, or asdbget will prompt otherwise.
	* XML_putc: '\'' => &apos;
	* Quote XML attribute values, expat, and therefore XML::Parser, do
	  not like the XML otherwise.
	* Patch for handling 'Z' (timestamp) fields from Gomez Henri, including
	  support in ASDB.dtd for specifying Z as field type.
	* Patch for using lib5250 for character conversion from Gomez Henri,
	  some clean up to dectect whether or not we have -l5250 at configure
	  time.  Currently does not detect newer (CVS) versions of lib5250.
	* Produce warning and still read response when last record is an
	  incomplete length.
