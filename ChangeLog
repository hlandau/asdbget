	* Password can now be specified by using ASDBGET_PASSWORD environment
	  variable, or asdbget will prompt otherwise.

	* Quote XML attribute values, expat, and therefore XML::Parser, do
	  not like the XML otherwise.
	* Patch for handling 'Z' (timestamp) fields from Gomez Henri, including
	  support in ASDB.dtd for specifying Z as field type.
	* Patch for using lib5250 for character conversion from Gomez Henri,
	  some clean up to dectect whether or not we have -l5250 at configure
	  time.  Currently does not detect newer (CVS) versions of lib5250.
	* Produce warning and still read response when last record is an
	  incomplete length.
